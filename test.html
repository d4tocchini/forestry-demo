  Normally, JavaScript apps aren’t pumping so much through the connections, but since the app is running it’s own multi-tab browser, analyzing/proxying all http/https/ws/wss connections, blocking ads, sharing the main thread with several other embedded electron apps  - we have a uniquely precious need for non-blocking I/O, unblocking the main electron thread and maximal concurrency.

  I’m loving Go, it’s a Google created language for exactly our use case.  And, as the creator of Node.js said,  “_I think Node is not the best system to build a massive server web. I would use Go for that. And honestly, that’s the reason why I left Node. It was the realization that: oh, actually, this is not the best server-side system ever._, and “”_If you’re building a server, I can’t imagine using anything other than Go_” — [https://www.mappingthejourney.com/single-post/2017/08/31/episode-8-interview-with-ryan-dahl-creator-of-nodejs/](https://www.mappingthejourney.com/single-post/2017/08/31/episode-8-interview-with-ryan-dahl-creator-of-nodejs/ "https://www.mappingthejourney.com/single-post/2017/08/31/episode-8-interview-with-ryan-dahl-creator-of-nodejs/")

  Go modules are compiled to self-contained binaries that work without external dependencies on all major OS’s!  This docker-like containerization process can also be used to our advantage in surprising ways:

   - protect our JavaScript source code, a notoriously difficult task for electron apps and JS in general

   - embed & utilize non-JS things like WordPress (think elegant themes) as a service

   - run proven & proper server infrastructure locally on the app while maintaining minimal footprint

   - like node.js, when & if needed, the app’s Go modules could be deployed as cloud services

  The Go frameworks I’m using make all this surprisingly easy, in particular:
